# Dog Vision Project (Neural Network Project)
### üê∂ Using Transfer Learning and TensorFlow 2.0 to Classify Different Dog Breeds

Who's that doggy in the window?

Dogs are incredible. But have you ever been sitting at a cafe, seen a dog and not known what breed it is? I have. And then someone says, "it's an English Terrier" and you think, how did they know that?

In this project we're going to be using machine learning to help us identify different breeds of dogs.

To do this, we'll be using data from the [Kaggle dog breed identification competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/overview). It consists of a collection of 10,000+ labelled images of 120 different dog breeds.

This kind of problem is called multi-class image classification. It's multi-class because we're trying to classify mutliple different breeds of dog. If we were only trying to classify dogs versus cats, it would be called binary classification (one thing versus another).
